# Human-Sea Attunement Project

Welcome to the Human-Sea Attunement Project! This repository contains code and resources for analyzing the interaction between human activities and sea oscillations. Our objective is to understand how the rhythms of the sea influence human brain activity and physiological responses, and how cultural perceptions shape this interaction.

## Introduction

This project aims to:

1. Investigate how sea rhythms synchronize with and influence brain activity and physiological responses.
2. Explore the role of cultural and personal perceptions of the sea in shaping cognitive and physiological integration.
3. Provide mechanistic explanations for the cognitive and physiological benefits associated with exposure to the sea.

## Installation

To get started:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/human-sea-attunement.git
   cd human-sea-attunement
